## Go FVM
Flutter SDK Version Manager written in Go.

### üç¶ Features
- [x] Manage Multiple Flutter SDKs
- [x] Project Versioning
- [x] **Portable** - No need to install Flutter SDK to install fvm
- [x] Auto config PATH and IDE settings


### üíæ Installation
- Download the latest release from [HERE](https://github.com/lollipopkit/gofvm/releases)
- `go install github.com/lollipopkit/gofvm@latest`

### üîñ Attention
- Under normal conditions: 
   1. Install `fvm` through `go install` or download the binary file. 
   2. It's highly recommended to set env `FVM_HOME`. If you don't set `FVM_HOME`, fvm will use `$HOME/.fvm` as default.
   3. Run `fvm install <version>` to install flutter sdk.
   4. Enter project folder, run `fvm use <version>` to use flutter sdk.
- This tool is largely compatible with `fvm-dart`, but there are still some differences. You may need to reconfigure the environment as described above.
- This tool is still in the early stage of development. If you encounter any problems, please submit an issue.
