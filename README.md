### üç¶ Features
- [x] Manage Multiple Flutter SDKs
- [x] Project Versioning
- [x] **Portable** - No need to install Flutter SDK to install fvm
- [x] Auto config PATH and IDE settings
- [x] Alias. e.g. `fvm dart format .` -> `dart format .`


### üíæ Uasge
1. Install `fvm` through `go install github.com/lollipopkit/fvm@latest` or download the latest release from [HERE](https://github.com/lollipopkit/fvm/releases). It's highly recommended to add `fvm` to PATH.
2. It's highly recommended to set env `FVM_HOME`. If you don't set `FVM_HOME`, fvm will use`$HOME/.fvm` as default.
3. Run `fvm install <version>` to install flutter sdk.
4. Set default global version by `fvm global <version>`.
5. Enter project folder, run `fvm use <version>` to use flutter sdk only in this directory.
6. Config alias by `fvm config alias`. So, you can omit `fvm` and use `dart` or `flutter` directly. eg. `dart format .` instead of `fvm dart format .`.


### üîñ Attention
- This tool is partly compatible with `fvm-dart`, but there are still some differences. You may need to reconfigure the environment as described above.
- This tool is still in the early stage of development. If you encounter any problems, please submit an issue.
